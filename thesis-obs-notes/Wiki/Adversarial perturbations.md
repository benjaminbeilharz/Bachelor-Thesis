# Adversarial perturbations
**Goal**: How can we change the input to achieve a different output.
- HotFlip [[Ebrahimi et al. 2018]]
- SEARs [[Ribeiro et al. 2018]]
- SCPN [[Iyyer et al. 2018]]
- AddSent [[Jia and Liang 2017]]

## Problems
- nonsensical inputs
	- humans cannot understand results
	- is a quantitative metric even sufficient on these inputs?
- overly specific to the example
	- does the perturbation apply more generally?
- intuitively explain the interpretation
