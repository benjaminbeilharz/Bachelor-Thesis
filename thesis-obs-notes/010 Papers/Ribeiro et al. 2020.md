- provides a framework called `CheckList` which provides three tests based on different methodologies
	- Minimum Functionality test (MFT): Generating a large number of samples based on a template (`"I {NEG} {POS_VERB} the {THING}"`) generated by this 
	- Invariance test (INV): Perturbations which should not change the output of a model, as seen in [[0211 EMNLP2020 Interpretability#Perturbations]]
	- Directional Expectation Test (DIR): Perturbations which should change the output in a certain way, as seen in [[0211 EMNLP2020 Interpretability#Perturbations]]

- generates tests with help of masked language models (RoBERTa) as [[Liu et al. 2019]]
- tests SOTA models with `CheckList` and measures error via a failure rate

Framework is open source on GitHub and can be found [here](https://github.com/marcotcr/checklist).
